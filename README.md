# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and Tkinter. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors match, with score tracking and a round counter.

- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most platforms)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `rock-paper-scissors.py` file.
